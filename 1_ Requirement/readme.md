The principal function of this WiperControl System, which is used in all types of automobiles, is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's wind shield. 
Because driving a vehicle in the rain is possible, deiver use wipers to clean the wind shield, so we can drive it even in the rain.


# PROCESS OF WORKING
Wipers switch on after 2 seconds of pressing the button.(onn is lead)
Wipers switch off after 4 seconds of pressing the button. (LED is turned off)


# Analysis of SWOT

Strength
Visibility
Safety



# Weakness
High price



# Threats
The board cannot be soon replaced once it is repaired.





## High level requirements




HR_01    Wiper turned on	    -  Implemente


HR_02	    Wiper turned off	 -   Implemented


## Low level requirements



LR_01	           Button pressed ONCE for 2sec(ON LED)            -	Implemented


LR_02	           Button pressed once again for 4 sec(OFF LED) 	  -  Implemented

## What
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.

## Why
To clean the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times from the front and rear windshields of the car.Wiper cleans the windshield by removing oil, dust, moisture, and grime that have become attached to the glass.

## Who
It is extremely important for drivers of any type of vehicle that require clear road visibility in the event of dust, snow, or rain.

## When
When the weather is terrible, such as snow, dust, or rain and so the windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

## How
It is implemented using the STM32 microcontroller and once when the rain droplets fall on the windshield of the vehicle.
