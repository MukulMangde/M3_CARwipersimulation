# M3_CARwipersimulation
## Introduction
The wiper cleans the front and rear windshields of the car, albeit not all cars have wipers on the back side. WIper cleans the windshield by removing oil, dust, moisture, and grime that have become attached. The raindrops that wets the glass will accumulate if there are no wipers, and the state of the screen will become unclear. Furthermore, grime that has adhered to the windscreen for an extended period of time is difficult to remove. If left untreated, it will obstruct the driver's vision and increase the danger of a car accident. Although the principle of this wiper system is identical to that of other conventional wipers, it will be improved to an automatic switching system by the end of the year.Deploying a controller When water falls over a specific sensor on the windscreen, it activates the wiper motor. The wiper will immediately stop if the sensor does not detect water.
