## car_wiper_control_system
A windshield wiper is a mechanism that clears rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, or debris from a car's front glass. Wipers are found on almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, cabin watercraft, and some aeroplanes. The wiper's primary duty is to wipe away various liquid particles from the screen by moving back and forth across the glass. The basic traditional windshield wiper speed varies according to time and vehicle speed, which not only requires the driver's attention but also causes some discomfort and serves as a source of distraction and difficulty, increasing the likelihood of an accident. So, we're using an STM32F4 discovery here.	
My goal is to use the STM-32 board to demonstrate a wiper system. The board comprises LEDs, which we must use to illustrate the wiper system.
Most wipers include a low, high, and intermittent speed option, as well as an intermittent mode. The motor runs constantly when the wipers are set to low or high speed. Some cars have only one intermittent speed option, while others have ten independent settings and still others include a sliding scale that may be set for nearly any time interval. To demonstrate this simulation we cannot show wiper movement in the simulation so instead of wiper I have used a in build LED light  that will help to understand the movement of the wiper.
