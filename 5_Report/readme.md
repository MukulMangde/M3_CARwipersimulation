My proposal, which I designed and presented, seems to be quite effective. 
It has great advantages over the sensor in that it can suit all required specifications and also the needs of such average individual. 
A speed-controlling mechanism might be added to this project to allow it to work in line with both the strength and pace of the water coming through the sensor. 
The approach I implemented is completely functional and can be used in any type of vehicle. 
This wiper system can also be made automatic by attaching sensor for rainwaterwater dropping on the wind shield, dust resistance sensor, and so on. 
As a result, there is no need to manually manage the wiper system while driving.

For exexution of project I have used the ST32 cube ide for the
