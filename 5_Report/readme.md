My proposal, which I designed and presented, seems to be quite effective. 
It has great advantages over the sensor in that it can suit all required specifications and also the needs of such average individual. 
A speed-controlling mechanism might be added to this project to allow it to work in line with both the strength and pace of the water coming through the sensor. 
The approach I implemented is completely functional and can be used in any type of vehicle. 
This wiper system can also be made automatic by attaching sensor for rainwaterwater dropping on the wind shield, dust resistance sensor, and so on. 
As a result, there is no need to manually manage the wiper system while driving.

For exexution of project I have used the ST32 cube ide for the

# Requirements for the project
## STM32CubeIDE
•	STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on the Eclipse/CDT framework and GCC toolchain for the development, and GDB for the debugging. It allows the integration of the hundreds of existing plugins that complete the features of the Eclipse IDE.
## Software used
### Xpack Packages
#### Windows Build Tools:
•	The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project
#### OpenOCD
•	Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. 
#### QEMU
•	The QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.
Components used in the project
## STM32F4O7VG Microcontroller board
The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications.It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.
## Features of STM32F407VG Microcontroller
•	In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.
•	On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)
•	USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
•	Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only)
•	Large-scale storage (with new order code only)
•	Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.
•	3 V and 5 V external application power supply.
## Uses of STM32F407VG Microcontroller
•	This Microcontroller is utilised in printing and scanning machines ,heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems.
•	This module can be found in a variety of household products.
